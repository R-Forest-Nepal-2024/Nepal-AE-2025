General method:

$$
B_{log} = V_{log, i} * \rho_{i}
$$

with $i$ the disc section matching the log.

$$
\rho_i = \frac{m_{dry,i}}{V_{fresh, i}}
$$

Gap filling in field/lab wood density values at disc section

When $m_{dry,i}$ is missing for a specific disc, it is recalculated from the the following method:

$$
m_{dry,i} = \chi_i \times m_{fresh, i}
$$

With

$\chi_i$ the mean tree moisture content of the tree if there is data and $\chi_i$ the mean moisture content of the species of all disc values are missing for a specific tree. This is valid for all species except Pr, as $\chi$ is constant across tree positions (when removing all disc with diameter overbark greater than 10cm.

For Pr, the moisture content decreases as the relative height of sample increases.

Detecting outliers

-   moisture content for logs:

    -   all values above 0.95 and below 0.15 were considered outliers

    -
